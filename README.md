## üìù Introduction

This repository contains the official implementation of **Deep Robust Reversible Watermarking (DRRW)**, a robust and cover-recoverable invisible image watermarking method. DRRW enables perfect reconstruction of the original cover image in lossless channels and robust watermark extraction in lossy channels.

DRRW leverages an **Integer Invertible Watermark Network (iIWN)** to achieve lossless and invertible mapping between cover-watermark pairs and stego images. It addresses the trade-off between robustness and reversibility in traditional robust reversible watermarking methods, offering significant improvements in robustness, visual quality, and computational efficiency.

Key features:
- **Robustness**: Enhanced against distortions through an Encoder-Noise Layer-Decoder framework.
- **Reversibility**: Ensures lossless recovery of both the cover image and the watermark in lossless channel.
- **Efficiency**: Reduces time complexity and auxiliary bitstream length.

## üöÄ Training

To train the DRRW model, use the following command:

```bash
python train_color.py
```

## üöÄ Evaluation

To test the DRRW model, use the following command:

```bash
python test.py
```

## üöÄ WatermarkLab

For evaluation and distortion layers, we utilize **WatermarkLab**, a comprehensive watermarking evaluation framework. WatermarkLab provides a wide range of distortion simulations and evaluation metrics to rigorously test the robustness and performance of watermarking algorithms.
